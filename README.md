# Shixxy Database
### A C++ wrapper for SQLite3

*2019-06-27* **Update to dependencies**

I have altered this repository to work more effectively with a Linux development environment. All dependencies are linked as if installed by a Linux package manager.

Packages needed:
- cmake
- sqlite-devel
- catch-devel

This has been developed on Fedora 30 and will be tested on other distributions later. I'll also see about getting those little "passing, build, tests" icons at the top of this README.

*2019-07-05* **New Install Location**

I noticed packages were being installed to `~/libs` and have thus changed my install script to put Shixxy libraries there too.
